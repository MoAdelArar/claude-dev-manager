Show the code style profile for the current project.

Use the cdm_get_codestyle tool with the current project's absolute root path.

The profile defines naming conventions, architecture pattern, error handling strategy, import style, formatting rules, testing patterns, and TypeScript usage that agents must follow when writing code for this project.

If no profile exists, suggest running /cdm-analyze to generate one.
