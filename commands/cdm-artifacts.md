List all artifacts produced during development.

Use the cdm_list_artifacts tool with the current project's absolute root path.

If the user asks for a specific type (e.g. "show me security reports"), use the type parameter to filter (e.g. type: "security_report").

Present the results grouped by type with counts, then list all artifacts with name, type, and status.
