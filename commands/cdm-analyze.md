Analyze the current project and generate a structured codebase analysis.

Use the cdm_analyze tool with the current project's absolute root path.

This generates .cdm/project-analysis.md which provides a compact summary of the entire codebase (file map, module exports/imports, dependency graph, patterns) that agents use as context instead of reading every file. Show the key stats when done.
